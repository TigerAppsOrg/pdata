Project Setup
=============

Quick Start
-----------

**Prerequisites**: This project uses `Python 3.6 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
and `pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org/>`_. Before proceeding, make sure to
install these and have Python 3.6 set as your default Python version
(recommended that you use a Python version manager like
`pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_).

To set up your development environment, install the Python dependencies from
pipenv:

.. code:: bash

  $ pipenv install

This installs dependencies to a virtual environment. To use them, activate the
virtual environment each time you want to work on the project:

.. code:: bash

  $ pipenv shell


Dependencies
------------

Below we list the Python dependencies required for the project (note that
these are automatically installed by pipenv).
